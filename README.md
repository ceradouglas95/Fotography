  <p><h3>Cera's Fotography Statement</h3></p>
      <p><h5>I use photography as a means of self-expression and finding myself. I make pictures for myself but also for the people around me so I can show them my understanding of reality. I pursue the real in a way to allow myself to explore the abstract of my mind. My goal is to use my camera and lenses to stop time for a fraction of a second to express relationships, stories, and the details that we miss on a daily basis.</p>
	<p>I photograph the world around me that is fuelled by the desire of uncovering the unknown about one’s stories and the stories the world has to offer. Everything has a story and it’s my job to show what lies in their past and the possibilities they have to give. Saying this, I take photographs of people and their journeys, but I enjoy showing the possibilities of the earth and wilderness more.</p>
	<p>My choice of subject comes from my interest in ideas about beauty and emotional connections. I enjoy finding photographs that capture candid moments so I photograph people in their natural environment to preserve that moment in time. Recently I have focused on portraits that capture mood through light and composition and macrophotography of nature.</p>
Photography is an exploration for me, a quest to capture elements of the abstract in nature. Before taking a photograph, I spend extended periods of time researching and getting to know the natural light, colors, shapes, textures and motion in the space. This process is intimate with the media and lets me discover something about the subject that I hadn’t noticed beforehand. Because I decided to take photography through the art department, rather than through the digital media department through Greenville University, I forced myself to find the importance of light, colors, shapes, textures, and movement. By learning some basics about drawing and painting, I was able to see the detail through an artist’s eye, which combined my passion for beautiful photography and working with my hands. I’ve learned how to make something come to life just from a blank page and now I’m pushing myself to share that in my photography.</p>
	<p>I encourage my audience to participate in the moments that I freeze with my photographs; moments that cannot be replicated but that I can share while giving a story. These one-framed stories can educate people of connotations, expressions, power structures, semiotics, and values all consisting in a culture that depends on social roles and economic status. Social documentation of people and nature shares a power of documenting something that tries to break the esoteric world, which provides communication amongst people groups.</p></h5></p></div>
